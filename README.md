# advent-2015

Solutions to the Advent of Code 2015 (see [official website](http://adventofcode.com/)) game, written in Haskell.

I wrote this as an exercise in writing Haskell code. It's probably not of interest to anyone else.

Stuff required so far: Data.Split, Data.Text, Data.Digest.Pure.MD5, Text.Parsec. Depends on GNU coreutils.
